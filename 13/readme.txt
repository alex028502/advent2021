I'm not especially happy with today's solution.

My solution trims blank rows and columns from the output, and I don't have
enough tests to confirm.  The message was forward and right side up, but that
was almost an accident.

Also I spend most of the time figure out how to parse the input and format the
output.  It would have been much more awesome to use racket to create another
language where the input file _is_ the script, since the folders are like
commands.
