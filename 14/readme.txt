When I finally realised what the scalable solution was, I had trouble
implementing it racket, so decided to use python

I ended up with an elegant implementation of the brute force method, and then
a brute force implementation of the elegant method.

Maybe one day I'll implement the python solution in LISP.

I should have realised earlier that I was trying to create a terrabyte string.
