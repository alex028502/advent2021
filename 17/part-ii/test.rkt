UNUSED
it turns out I didn't need to know this for part i. I could have done it this
way once I had narrowed down the range.. but I eventually narrowed down the
range to one vertical velocity, and figured out that I don't need to know the
horizontal component to answer the question

there are nine zones - but some can be grouped
take a look at sample.txt

S - short
L - long
T - on target
. - don't know yet
U - unlucky

if it hits an unlucky zone I can't use that value, but I can't stop sweeping
either - just skip to the next one

y to list-ref conversion
 1   0
 0   1
-1   2
-2   3
list-ref is (- 1 y)
