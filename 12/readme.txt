Wow. That was amazing.

I finished in just over three hours today. The part that took the longest was
creating a two way hash of of all the connections between the nodes.

I have always wanted to know how to solve problems like this whenever I used
public transportation journey planners. If I ever searched how on the web I
either couldn't find good answers, or hadn't developed the skills to understand
the answers.

The "curator" of _Advent of Code_ has somehow led me through a series of small
steps to make the answer (and _an_ answer) obvious to me.

I added a parameter so that this can solve part i and part ii. The difference
between my two programs (the current one and the one a few commits ago) really
shows how fast a program can degrade from totally elegant to spaghetti as you
add features.
