used a "module" this with a main function instead of a main program. also didn't
parse input file - was only two numbers so just used them as arguments.

The end to end test was not really necessary because the unit tests test the
main function, except that the first time I ran the program, I realised main was
set up to accept integers. so always work making sure the whole thing works.
